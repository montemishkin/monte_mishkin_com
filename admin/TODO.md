- django admin site
    - disable taggit app (since I have my own custom models and admin components)
    - project and post views
        - make it so tags selection only allows already created tags

- figure out deployment (wsgi, etc...)
    - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/deployment/
    - run at `admin.monte.mishkin.com`
