(You can find a quick run-through of the tech stack [here](/posts/homepage-tech-stack), and the entire source code [here](https://github.com/montemishkin/montemishkin).)\r\n\r\nThree years ago I couldn't have even told you what a server was, but today my homepage is live.  And although the technology stack is overkill for the job, it's been an amazing learning experience that I certainly don't regret.  The entire process was a stepping stone that now marks my entry into a community that I am very excited to be a part of.\r\n\r\n\r\n### First Encounters\r\n\r\nToward the end of my first year in college I knew close to nothing about computer programming.  But it had always interested me in a sort of mystical way.  Perhaps that's why, when my roommate (who was taking an introductory programming course at the time) told me that I didn't need a special type of computer in order to program, I didn't quite believe him at first.\r\n\r\nBut I was quickly convinced once he showed me that I could [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for *free* online and get right to coding.  Of course, I had no idea what Python was (and downloading it wasn't much help), but up until then I had legitimately thought that learning to program computers was a strange and exclusive discipline known only to the occult.  Lucky for me, my roommate had a spell book to guide me through this dark art.  And so, sitting at my dorm room desk with my fresh Python download and my roommate's [textbook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0763746029), I began my journey into the world of computer science.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contemporary Spells and Incantations\r\n\r\nFast forward three years and I still see computer science as a form of magic.  But now I see it from the eyes of an adept spell-caster.  Don't get me wrong: I'm no master sorcerer.  But at the same time, I do possess some notable powers.  \r\n\r\nWith a few keystrokes I can:\r\n\r\n- spin up a web server.\r\n- make a video game.\r\n- accidentally destroy my computer.\r\n\r\nOf course, this list is not exhaustive, but the idea is there: **I can cause far reaching consequences simply by writing out special sequences of symbols**.  And on top of all that, I know what I am doing! (most of the time)\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Quest\r\n\r\nBy the time I finished college in June 2015, I decided I was going to make a profession of this.  Trouble is, I graduated with degrees in mathematics and physics, neither of which are computer science.  Why should anybody have hired me as a programmer, when I had almost nothing to show that I could do the job?\r\n\r\nThey shouldn't have.  And so I didn't ask anybody to.  Instead, I asked myself how I could demonstrate to potential employers that I am a worthwhile candidate.  I decided to make myself a website.\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Road to React\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure exactly how I wanted to go about making myself a website.  In fact, at that point there were a lot of parts about making a website I knew almost nothing about.\r\n\r\nWhat I did know was that I didn't want to simply host static pages on [github.io](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  (Of course, that would have been one of the *quickest* ways to get a reasonable homepage up and running.)  Instead, **I wanted to build my homepage using some of the technologies I hoped to actually use at a future job**.  This would serve as a way of both getting more experience with the tools, and demonstrating familiarity with them.\r\n\r\nAt the time, I knew how to get by with [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) and had heard of [Angular](https://angularjs.org/).  I had completed [Django's](https://www.djangoproject.com/) [beginners guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial01/), but had no idea how to actually deploy a site.  In fact, I was still learning the basics of how to use a UNIX shell.  Thus I set out to learn more about the entire life cycle of a website.\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Many Roads Beyond\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the way, I got turned on to [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).  This really changed the game, and not just because the functional aspects of React's philosophy made more intuitive sense to me.  React was (and has continued to be) instrumental for my growth in large part because it led me down a path to discovering several more influential ideas including:\r\n\r\n- [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) (and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/))\r\n- [universal](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9) javascript\r\n- the [micro-service](https://www.nginx.com/blog/introduction-to-microservices/) architecture\r\n- [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/)\r\n\r\nReact and Redux in particular have fostered in me a greater understanding of [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) methodologies, which in turn has helped me better understand [object oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) as well.  In fact, React + Redux has essentially caused a massive shift in the way I think about software design in general.\r\n\r\nOf course, I am inevitably part of the [hype cycle](http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp) for a lot of these technologies, but I don't regret that for one second: **I have learned a lot about the strengths and weaknesses of my toolchain** (and invariably those parts of other toolchains that I can compare and contrast with parts of my own).\r\n\r\nIn fact, I feel very lucky to be entering the industry at a time like this, where I have the opportunity to make influential contributions to many of these awesome ideas.  Today, my homepage is live and I am just starting out.  But tomorrow, you'll be hearing more from me.","created":{"year":2016,"month":2,"day":2},"tags":["redux","magic","python","monte","react"],"url":"/posts/hello-world","isLoading":false,"loadDateTime":1649483318550}},"isLoading":false},"tags":{"items":{"redux":{"slug":"redux","name":"redux","description":"","url":"/tags/redux","isLoading":false,"loadDateTime":1649483318550},"magic":{"slug":"magic","name":"magic","description":"","url":"/tags/magic","isLoading":false,"loadDateTime":1649483318550},"python":{"slug":"python","name":"python","description":"","url":"/tags/python","isLoading":false,"loadDateTime":1649483318550},"monte":{"slug":"monte","name":"monte","description":"","url":"/tags/monte","isLoading":false,"loadDateTime":1649483318550},"react":{"slug":"react","name":"react","description":"","url":"/tags/react","isLoading":false,"loadDateTime":1649483318550}},"isLoading":false}};

<p>React and Redux in particular have fostered in me a greater understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" target="_blank">functional programming</a> methodologies, which in turn has helped me better understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">object oriented programming</a> as well.  In fact, React + Redux has essentially caused a massive shift in the way I think about software design in general.</p>
<p>Of course, I am inevitably part of the <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp" target="_blank">hype cycle</a> for a lot of these technologies, but I don&#39;t regret that for one second: <strong>I have learned a lot about the strengths and weaknesses of my toolchain</strong> (and invariably those parts of other toolchains that I can compare and contrast with parts of my own).</p>
<p>In fact, I feel very lucky to be entering the industry at a time like this, where I have the opportunity to make influential contributions to many of these awesome ideas.  Today, my homepage is live and I am just starting out.  But tomorrow, you&#39;ll be hearing more from me.</p>
