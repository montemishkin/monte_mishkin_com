        window.__INITIAL_STATE__ = {"posts":{"items":{"hello-world":{"slug":"hello-world","title":"Hello World","subtitle":"Nice to meet you!","content":"My homepage is distributed between two services, one of which renders a [universal](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9) single page application, and the other of which serves a [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) api wrapping a [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database. (You can find a quick run-through of the tech stack [here](/posts/homepage-tech-stack), and the entire source code [here](https://github.com/montemishkin/montemishkin).)\r\n\r\nThree years ago I couldn't have even told you what a server was, but today my homepage is live.  And although the technology stack is overkill for the job, it's been an amazing learning experience that I certainly don't regret.  The entire process was a stepping stone that now marks my entry into a community that I am very excited to be a part of.\r\n\r\n\r\n### First Encounters\r\n\r\nToward the end of my first year in college I knew close to nothing about computer programming.  But it had always interested me in a sort of mystical way.  Perhaps that's why, when my roommate (who was taking an introductory programming course at the time) told me that I didn't need a special type of computer in order to program, I didn't quite believe him at first.\r\n\r\nBut I was quickly convinced once he showed me that I could [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for *free* online and get right to coding.  Of course, I had no idea what Python was (and downloading it wasn't much help), but up until then I had legitimately thought that learning to program computers was a strange and exclusive discipline known only to the occult.  Lucky for me, my roommate had a spell book to guide me through this dark art.  And so, sitting at my dorm room desk with my fresh Python download and my roommate's [textbook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0763746029), I began my journey into the world of computer science.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contemporary Spells and Incantations\r\n\r\nFast forward three years and I still see computer science as a form of magic.  But now I see it from the eyes of an adept spell-caster.  Don't get me wrong: I'm no master sorcerer.  But at the same time, I do possess some notable powers.  \r\n\r\nWith a few keystrokes I can:\r\n\r\n- spin up a web server.\r\n- make a video game.\r\n- accidentally destroy my computer.\r\n\r\nOf course, this list is not exhaustive, but the idea is there: **I can cause far reaching consequences simply by writing out special sequences of symbols**.  And on top of all that, I know what I am doing! (most of the time)\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Quest\r\n\r\nBy the time I finished college in June 2015, I decided I was going to make a profession of this.  Trouble is, I graduated with degrees in mathematics and physics, neither of which are computer science.  Why should anybody have hired me as a programmer, when I had almost nothing to show that I could do the job?\r\n\r\nThey shouldn't have.  And so I didn't ask anybody to.  Instead, I asked myself how I could demonstrate to potential employers that I am a worthwhile candidate.  I decided to make myself a website.\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Road to React\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure exactly how I wanted to go about making myself a website.  In fact, at that point there were a lot of parts about making a website I knew almost nothing about.\r\n\r\nWhat I did know was that I didn't want to simply host static pages on [github.io](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  (Of course, that would have been one of the *quickest* ways to get a reasonable homepage up and running.)  Instead, **I wanted to build my homepage using some of the technologies I hoped to actually use at a future job**.  This would serve as a way of both getting more experience with the tools, and demonstrating familiarity with them.\r\n\r\nAt the time, I knew how to get by with [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) and had heard of [Angular](https://angularjs.org/).  I had completed [Django's](https://www.djangoproject.com/) [beginners guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial01/), but had no idea how to actually deploy a site.  In fact, I was still learning the basics of how to use a UNIX shell.  Thus I set out to learn more about the entire life cycle of a website.\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Many Roads Beyond\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the way, I got turned on to [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).  This really changed the game, and not just because the functional aspects of React's philosophy made more intuitive sense to me.  React was (and has continued to be) instrumental for my growth in large part because it led me down a path to discovering several more influential ideas including:\r\n\r\n- [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) (and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/))\r\n- [universal](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9) javascript\r\n- the [micro-service](https://www.nginx.com/blog/introduction-to-microservices/) architecture\r\n- [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/)\r\n\r\nReact and Redux in particular have fostered in me a greater understanding of [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) methodologies, which in turn has helped me better understand [object oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) as well.  In fact, React + Redux has essentially caused a massive shift in the way I think about software design in general.\r\n\r\nOf course, I am inevitably part of the [hype cycle](http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp) for a lot of these technologies, but I don't regret that for one second: **I have learned a lot about the strengths and weaknesses of my toolchain** (and invariably those parts of other toolchains that I can compare and contrast with parts of my own).\r\n\r\nIn fact, I feel very lucky to be entering the industry at a time like this, where I have the opportunity to make influential contributions to many of these awesome ideas.  Today, my homepage is live and I am just starting out.  But tomorrow, you'll be hearing more from me.","created":{"year":2016,"month":2,"day":2},"tags":["redux","magic","python","monte","react"],"url":"/posts/hello-world","isLoading":false,"loadDateTime":1649483318813},"homepage-tech-stack":{"slug":"homepage-tech-stack","title":"Homepage Tech Stack","subtitle":"Over engineered? Yes and no.","content":"My homepage is distributed between two services, one of which renders a [universal](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9) single page application, and the other of which serves a [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) api wrapping a [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database. (You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/montemishkin/montemishkin).)\r\n\r\nWas this overkill given the task at hand?  Probably.  Hosting static pages on [github.io](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) would have:\r\n\r\n- been much quicker and easier to develop.\r\n- been much quicker and easier to deploy.\r\n- been much easier to maintain.\r\n- totally worked fine.\r\n\r\nDo I regret it?  No.  **I wanted to build my homepage using some of the technologies I hoped to actually use at a future job**.  As a result, **I have learned a lot about the strengths and weaknesses of my toolchain** (and invariably those parts of other toolchains that I can compare and contrast with parts of my own).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Outline of the tech stack\r\n\r\nTo start, here is an outline of the main tools used for each part of the site.  Of course, this is **just an outline**, and is therefore **not an exhaustive list**.  For more detail, you can check out the [entire source code](https://github.com/montemishkin/montemishkin) for the site.\r\n\r\n- **Frontend**\r\n    - **Source**\r\n        - [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/): For building user interfaces.\r\n        - [Redux](http://redux.js.org/): To manage data flow.\r\n        - [Radium](http://stack.formidable.com/radium/): To manage inline styles.\r\n    - **Development**\r\n        - [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/): To manage common development tasks.\r\n        - [Eslint](http://eslint.org/): To help me not make silly mistakes.\r\n        - [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/): To bundle javascript modules.\r\n        - [Babel](https://babeljs.io/): To enable modern javascript language features.\r\n- **Backend**\r\n    - A [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) service responsible for rendering the [universal](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9) single page application.  (Since it is universal, all of the tools mentioned for the frontend apply here as well.)\r\n\r\n        - **Source**\r\n            - [Express](http://expressjs.com/en/index.html): As a small convenience wrapper over node's native http module.\r\n        - **Deployment**\r\n            - [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/): As a reverse proxy.\r\n            - [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/): To manage node processes.\r\n            - [Upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/): To manage the node service as a linux service.\r\n    - A [Python](https://www.python.org/) service responsible for serving the [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) api that wraps my database.\r\n\r\n        - **Source**\r\n            - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/): For a few different reasons.  See below.\r\n            - [Graphene](http://graphene-python.org/): For building the [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) api.\r\n        - **Deployment**\r\n            - [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/): As a reverse proxy.\r\n            - [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/): To serve the Django application.\r\n            - [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/): To store my data!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why Django? Didn't you say *micro*-service?\r\n\r\nI agree, a Django project does **not** constitute a *micro*-service.  I used Django anyways because I wanted to get my site up sooner rather than later, while still tackling the smallest possible case of a distributed architecture (just two services).\r\n\r\nThis way, I could focus on some of the more basic principles from the complicated art of managing a distributed architecture and less on trying to masterfully compose all of the services.  It also helped me not get overwhelmed by a deep dive into the world of micro-services.  Besides, **I can (and will) further granularize this service later on**.\r\n\r\nRight now, I use Django (rather than something more lightweight such as [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)) mostly because Django can easily ship with an automatically generated website administration interface (I am essentially using it as a [CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)).  From the Django [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial02/#introducing-the-django-admin):\r\n\r\n> Generating admin sites for your staff or clients to add, change, and delete content is tedious work that doesn’t require much creativity. For that reason, Django entirely automates creation of admin interfaces for models.\r\n\r\nDjango is also responsible for serving the GraphQL api that wraps my database, but if this were all I needed, I would use something more lightweight (like Flask).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nAnyways, this is where things stand at the moment.  I'll continue to improve the project over time to boost my skills as a developer and maintainer.

Of course, this list is not exhaustive, but the idea is there: **I can cause far reaching consequences simply by writing out special sequences of symbols**.  And on top of all that, I know what I am doing! (most of the time)


### The Quest

By the time I finished college in June 2015, I decided I was going to make a profession of this.  Trouble is, I graduated with degrees in mathematics and physics, neither of which are computer science.  Why should anybody have hired me as a programmer, when I had almost nothing to show that I could do the job?

They shouldn&#x27;t have.  And so I didn&#x27;t ask anybody to.  Instead, I asked myself how I could demonstrate to potential employers that I am a worthwhile candidate.  I decided to make myself a website.


### The Road to React

I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how I wanted to go about making myself a website.  In fact, at that point there were a lot of parts about making a website I knew almost nothing about.

What I did know was that I didn&#x27;t want to simply host static pages on [github.io](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  (Of course, that would have been one of the *quickest* ways to get a reasonable homepage up and running.)  Instead, **I wanted to build my homepage using some of the technologies I hoped to actually use at a future job**.  This would serve as a way of both getting more experience with the tools, and demonstrating familiarity with them.

At the time, I knew how to get by with [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) and had heard of [Angular](https://angularjs.org/).  I had completed [Django&#x27;s](https://www.djangoproject.com/) [beginners guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial01/), but had no idea how to actually deploy a site.  In fact, I was still learning the basics of how to use a UNIX shell.  Thus I set out to learn more about the entire life cycle of a website.


### The Many Roads Beyond

Somewhere along the way, I got turned on to [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).  This really changed the game, and not just because the functional aspects of React&#x27;s philosophy made more intuitive sense to me.  React was (and has continued to be) instrumental for my growth in large part because it led me down a path to discovering several more influential ideas including:

- [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) (and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/))
- [universal](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9) javascript
- the [micro-service](https://www.nginx.com/blog/introduction-to-microservices/) architecture
- [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/)

React and Redux in particular have fostered in me a greater understanding of [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) methodologies, which in turn has helped me better understand [object oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) as well.  In fact, React + Redux has essentially caused a massive shift in the way I think about software design in general.

Of course, I am inevitably part of the [hype cycle](http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp) for a lot of these technologies, but I don&#x27;t regret that for one second: **I have learned a lot about the strengths and weaknesses of my toolchain** (and invariably those parts of other toolchains that I can compare and contrast with parts of my own).

In fact, I feel very lucky to be entering the industry at a time like this, where I have the opportunity to make influential contributions to many of these awesome ideas.  Today, my homepage is live and I am just starting out.  But tomorrow, you&#x27;ll be hearing more from me." class="container_zc68gr undefined" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0"><div class="container_zc68gr undefined" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0.$=10"><a class="link_4133r1" style="text-decoration:none;" href="../posts/hello-world.html" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0.$=10.0"><h3 class="title_10jesm4" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0.$=10.0.$=1$=01$=0010">Hello World</h3><p class="subtitle_1a71oku" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0.$=10.0.$=1$=01$=0011">Nice to meet you!</p></a></div><ul class="tagList_1undorb" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0.$/=11"><li class="tagListItem_1svlhgv undefined" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0.$/=11.$0//=1$=01$0/=1$0/=01$=001$0"><a class="tagListItemLink_pvzi8e" title="" style="text-decoration:none;" href="redux.html" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0.$/=11.$0//=1$=01$0/=1$0/=01$=001$0.$=1$0">redux</a></li><li class="tagListItem_1svlhgv" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0.$/=11.$=1$1/=01$=001$1"><a class="tagListItemLink_pvzi8e" title="" style="text-decoration:none;" href="magic.html" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0.$/=11.$=1$1/=01$=001$1.$=1$1">magic</a></li><li class="tagListItem_1svlhgv" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0.$/=11.$=1$2/=01$=001$2"><a class="tagListItemLink_pvzi8e" title="" style="text-decoration:none;" href="python.html" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0.$/=11.$=1$2/=01$=001$2.$=1$2">python</a></li><li class="tagListItem_1svlhgv" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0.$/=11.$=1$3/=01$=001$3"><a class="tagListItemLink_pvzi8e" title="" style="text-decoration:none;" href="monte.html" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0.$/=11.$=1$3/=01$=001$3.$=1$3">monte</a></li><li class="tagListItem_1svlhgv undefined" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0.$/=11.$4//=1$=01$4/=1$4/=01$=001$4"><a class="tagListItemLink_pvzi8e" title="" style="text-decoration:none;" href="react.html" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0.$/=11.$4//=1$=01$4/=1$4/=01$=001$4.$=1$4">react</a></li></ul><time class="date_8z26o5" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.2.0.1.1.$0//=1$0/=1$0/=01$0.$0.$=12">Feb 2, 2016</time></section></li></ul></article></div></main><footer class="outerContainer_1bv97vk" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.3"><div class="innerContainer_5ks784" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.3.0"><ul class="navLinks_1gchers" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.3.0.0"><li class="undefined undefined" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.3.0.0.$0//=10/=1$0/=010"><a class="navLink_vlzw6t" href="../index.html" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.3.0.0.$0//=10/=1$0/=010.0">HOME</a></li><li data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.3.0.0.$=1$1/=011"><a class="navLink_vlzw6t" style="text-decoration:none;" href="../about.html" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.3.0.0.$=1$1/=011.0">ABOUT</a></li><li class="undefined undefined" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.3.0.0.$2//=12/=1$2/=012"><a class="navLink_vlzw6t" style="text-decoration:none;" href="../posts.html" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.3.0.0.$2//=12/=1$2/=012.0">BLOG</a></li></ul><div class="copyright_1yhgeld" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.3.0.1"><span data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.3.0.1.0">©</span><span data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.3.0.1.1"> 2022 </span><a href="mailto:monte@mishkin.com" class="emailLink_vpbj37" data-reactid=".akcv2whs00.3.0.1.2">MM</a></div></div></footer></div></div>
